  <p>On October 5, 2011, the cargo ship, Rena, ran aground off the Bay of Plenty in New
  Zealand, spilling 350 tons of oil into the ocean and creating the country&rsquo;s worst
  environmental disaster in decades. Large areas<!--more--> of coastline were polluted and more than
  a thousand sea birds were killed. The native Blue Penguin population was especially
  affected.</p>

  <p>A huge cleanup operation was immediately put in place to limit the impact on the
  animals, birds and fish that inhabit the ocean and shoreline. Injured and sick animals
  were taken to shelters where they could be treated and rehabilitated.</p>

  <p>Penguins are especially at risk in disasters like this because of the effect oil has
  on the birds&rsquo; feathers. The feathers of a penguin are unique in that they are
  designed to form a watertight barrier against the wet and cold. Once even a small
  amount of oil gets on a penguin&rsquo;s feathers, the natural barrier is compromised,
  putting the birds at risk. To make matters worse, as the penguins try to preen
  themselves, they ingest the toxic oil.</p>

  <p>Due to the large number of penguins rescued, it was going to take some time to treat
  them all and wash them clean. So, word went out that little knitted sweaters were
  needed to keep the penguins warm and prevent them preening until they could be cleaned
  up.</p>

  <p>Skeinz, a yarn store in Napier, New Zealand, saw the opportunity to help by creating
  a pattern for the &ldquo;penguin jumpers&rdquo; and then alerting all their customers
  to the plight of the penguins by posting the story on their website. They encouraged
  everyone to knit penguin jumpers and arranged to be the collection point for the
  finished garments. This request quickly went viral and people from around the world,
  seeing an opportunity to help, took action by knitting their own versions of the
  jumpers. The response was huge and before long the store had collected enough penguin
  jumpers for all the birds in need.</p>

  <p>Amazingly, the sweaters kept coming, in all colours and patterns, until there were
  in excess of 5,000 sweaters, and Skeinz begged people to please stop sending the
  jumpers. So now the question was, what were they going to do with all those excess
  sweaters?</p>

  <p>The solution was the formation of the Skeinz Penguin Rescue Fund, based on a similar
  Australian initiative, the Penguin Foundation, formed after the 2002 oil spill off
  Tasmania. The leftover jumpers were used to &lsquo;dress&rsquo; toy penguins and sell
  them from the Skeinz website. All the money from the sales go directly into the Skeinz
  Penguin Fund, which has already donated much-needed money to NZ Forest &amp; Bird to
  help with the rehabilitation of the area and is providing on-going support for penguin
  populations around New Zealand.</p>

  <p>Want to get in on the action? Visit the Skeinz website to see the cute toy penguins
  in their smart sweaters; they would make a perfect gift for anyone, young and old
  alike.</p>

  <p>If you are a knitter, you can help with the on-going work of the Skeinz Penguin
  Rescue Fund by copying the pattern from the site and creating your own special penguin
  jumpers to donate to the cause. All the proceeds from the sale of the toy penguins are
  used to ensure the on-going health and survival of penguin populations.</p>

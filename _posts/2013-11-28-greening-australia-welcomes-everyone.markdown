  <p>An organization that is truly passionate about &ldquo;protecting and restoring the
  health, diversity and productivity of the unique Australian landscapes&rdquo; is
  Greening Australia. Their mission is to involve the general community in the management
  of vegetation to<!--more--> help protect Australia&rsquo;s unique landscapes and environment.</p>
   
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Greening Australia is about doing practical
    things &hellip;</strong></span></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Greening Australia is about doing practical things to address the problems that
  beset our environment. It has a thirty year track record in the creation of sustainable
  environments in metropolitan, regional and remote areas of Australia. The organisation
  addresses and acts upon important problems like soil degradation, erosion, salinity and
  loss of biodiversity, using a unique approach that combines science, practical
  experience and community involvement.</p>

  <p>The Gondawana Link is a current ambitious project that Greening Australia is part
  of. Reputed to be the largest land restoration activity anywhere in the world, the aim
  is to restore the country&rsquo;s only known biodiversity hotspot, situated in southern
  Western Australia. The area has achieved international attention on account of its
  unique fauna and flora; it is believed to have in excess of 1,500 different species of
  animals and plants.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">&hellip; the largest land restoration
    activity anywhere in the world &hellip;</span></strong></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Over the years of European settlement, large tracts of land have been cleared for
  agriculture, thus fragmenting this important landscape. Fortunately, scattered areas of
  bushland have survived and the goal of the alliance responsible for the Gondwana Link
  is to join up these islands of biodiversity to form a continuous corridor.&nbsp; The
  project will eventually create an incredible 1,000 kilometre arc of restored bushland,
  stretching from the wet forests of the south western tip of the state right across to
  the Nullarbor Plain; from the Margaret River right through to the goldfields.</p>

  <p>Abandoned farms are being bought up and existing bushland is being monitored and
  maintained. The cleared land and existing bushland will be combined with national parks
  to eventually form the unbroken corridor. The alliance views the program as a major
  carbon sequestering process as well as a huge land restoration project. Talk about a
  win-win situation!</p>

  <p>This is really important work, vital to retaining the biodiversity of the area for
  future generations. The alliance of organisations involved should be congratulated for
  having the vision to take on such an enormous task. More than 6,000 hectares has been
  bought already and nearly 2,000 hectares of this has been replanted to date.</p>

  <p>House plants have always been a common feature of home decor but a popular trend in
  recent times is growing herbs and vegetables right in the kitchen so they are close at
  hand when cooking. No more<!--more--> stumbling around the garden in the dark, trying to locate
  herbs to use for dinner.</p>

  <p>As well as convenience, studies suggest a number of health benefits to growing your
  own vegetables and herbs. When looked after correctly, home-grown veggies contain more
  nutrients and are naturally fresher than produce sold in shops. Added to this is the
  enjoyment and sense of satisfaction you get from growing your own food.</p>

  <p>Some varieties of plants lend themselves better to being grown indoors than others
  but, generally, culinary herbs are versatile enough to thrive inside. Easy to grow
  herbs include parsley, basil, coriander, chives, oregano and thyme. As long as the
  plants have sufficient light and water, as well as high quality soil, they should grow
  as well as they would outdoors in the garden. Vegetables that can be grown successfully
  indoors include leafy greens like lettuce, spinach and kale and tomatoes, especially
  the small salad varieties.</p>

  <p>To give your garden that added touch, you will want to choose pots that complement
  your kitchen decor. There is a huge range of pots available including terracotta,
  bright colors and stainless steel. They can simply be placed on a bright windowsill or
  bench top, or hung from pot hangers. IKEA make different styles of pots that hang from
  rods, which can be suspended inside a window frame. These can look great when you can
  have more than one row of pots on the same window. To check out some of IKEA&rsquo;s
  different styles available on Amazon, <a href="http://amzn.to/1hAP3QO" rel=

  <p>So why not try your hand at growing some kitchen greenery so you too can have the
  health benefits of having plants indoors as well as fresh herbs and vegetables right
  there at your fingertips.</p>

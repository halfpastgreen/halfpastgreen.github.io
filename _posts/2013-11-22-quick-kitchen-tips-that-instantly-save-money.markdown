  <p>Many people believe that adopting a greener lifestyle is going to cost more money.
  While this may be true in some areas, such as buying organic foods, there are many
  green options available that will actually save<!--more--> money. Here are some simple ways to go
  green and save money in the kitchen.</p>

  <p>The trick with changing some of your habits is to make several small changes rather
  than going overboard with something major. There is less &lsquo;pain&rsquo; this way
  because small things are easier to do but you will still be lessening your impact on
  the planet.</p>

  <p>Because you pay for what you use with power and water, these are obvious areas to
  make some changes and reduce your consumption. It&rsquo;s simple arithmetic: use less
  and you will pay less. Water is a finite resource on our planet and conserving it is
  essential.</p>

    too cold &hellip;</strong></span></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The simplest strategies to reduce power and water usage have been talked about for a
  while now. These include turning off lights when you leave a room, switching appliances
  off at the wall to avoid stand-by power, not leaving taps running and limiting shower
  times.</p>

  <p>Many people will by now have changed their light globes over to CFLs, saving up
  to<br />
  70% of lighting costs. In the kitchen, a CFL in the central light provides good general
  lighting but halogens installed directly over work surfaces give a more directed light
  where you really need it rather than illuminating the whole room. LEDs are now being
  used increasingly in the same locations as halogens and will also cut your electricity
  bills.</p>

  <p>Kitchen appliances account for about 13% of energy usage, so it will pay you to
  consider how you use them. The refrigerator is the biggest culprit, using nearly 8% of
  the electricity in your home. In fact, fridges generally use more power than lights, so
  they represent the greatest area for savings. Research shows that most people run their
  refrigerators too cold most of the year and this is just a waste of money. The ideal
  temperature is between one and five degrees Celsius and it pays to experiment with the
  ideal temperature of your fridge at different times of the year.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&hellip; defrost food in the fridge to
    reduce power &hellip;</strong></span></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Avoid putting hot food into the refrigerator, defrost food in the fridge to reduce
  power use, make sure the appliance isn&rsquo;t close to a heat source, limit how often
  the door is opened and check that the door seals are intact. Cleaning the condenser
  twice a year helps it work more efficiently. Refrigerators work most efficiently when
  they are not packed too full whereas freezers work more efficiently when they are
  packed tight. Having said that, it uses more electricity to run a near empty fridge
  than a full one so put in bottles of water and other beverages to fill the empty
  space.</p>

  <p>The dishwasher is probably the next biggest power guzzler in the kitchen but
  don&rsquo;t be afraid to use it; research has shown that running a full dishwasher is a
  greener option than washing dishes by hand. Just check the settings and use those that
  are the most energy efficient. Look up your manual and see if you can adjust the
  temperature the water is heated to. 45 -50 degrees Celsius is sufficient to clean
  dishes properly; any higher is just wasting electricity. Open the door to air dry
  rather than using power for the drying cycle.</p>

  <p>You can also save on water costs in the kitchen and, at the same time, help to
  preserve this precious resource. Fix dripping taps; a surprising amount of water is
  lost this way. Slow the flow of water by installing low flow aerators to taps. These
  simple-to-install devices add air to the water, reducing water usage without affecting
  water pressure. Only use the hot tap when you need a large amount of hot water, as even
  if you only draw the cold water that is in the pipes of the hot water tap, that amount
  will be reheated, using extra power. The most energy-efficient water heaters are the
  instantaneous types that heat water on demand rather than heating a whole tank of
  stored water.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>&hellip; only boil the amount of water you
    need &hellip;</strong></span></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Use an appliance to suit the amount of food you&rsquo;re cooking, to reduce energy
  usage. It uses less power to run a small appliance or small saucepan on a small stove
  top burner. Only boil the amount of water you need rather than filling the kettle to
  the top. The oven is the least energy-efficient way to cook so get organized and cook
  several dishes at the same time when you need to use your oven. When cooking with an
  electric stove or oven, make use of the stored heat by turning off the burner before
  the food is ready.</p>

  <p>While I&rsquo;ve focused on power and water usage with these tips on how to go green
  in the kitchen and save money, there are many other ways to do so. I will cover some of
  these in a later article. Put some or all of these strategies in place in your home and
  watch your power and water bills drop. My bills feature a little graph that compares
  current usage with past billing periods. It&rsquo;s also great to compare your usage
  with the average of similar households in your area; this is another feature on my
  bills.</p>

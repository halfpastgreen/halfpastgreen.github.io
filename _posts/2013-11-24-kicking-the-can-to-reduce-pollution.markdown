  <h3>On average, 266 cans and bottles become litter or landfill every second in
  Australia.</h3>

  <p>This represents 8 billion drink containers every year filling the tips or littering
  our environment. We&rsquo;ve all seen them, in almost every place<!--more--> we go but it appears
  to be an insurmountable problem. Beverage containers remain in landfill for a very long
  time, kill wildlife and pollute our oceans. However, there is an organization
  that&rsquo;s doing something about eliminating the tossed can and you can get
  involved.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kicking the Can&rdquo; is an alliance of various Australian groups, called
  the Boomerang Alliance, and includes local councils, community and environmental
  organizations that have come together to encourage a national solution to this
  universal problem. There are 26 state and national groups in the alliance and they have
  been working and lobbying for more than 10 years to develop a solution to this
  problem.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong><span style="color: #333333;">&hellip; littering of drink cans is limited
    &hellip; where a 10c refund is available &hellip;</span></strong></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>What they have discovered through research is that littering of drink cans is
  limited in South Australia where a 10c refund has been available on cans and bottles
  since 1977. The Northern Territory has a similar container deposit system. Based on the
  experience of these two systems, the Alliance has developed container deposit
  legislation that has been hailed as &ldquo;the best container deposit system in the
  world&rdquo; by international experts in this field.</p>

  <p>The Boomerang Alliance is advocating the introduction of a national container
  deposit scheme that provides a 10c refund, so all states and territories can enjoy the
  liberation from the litter that South Australians have. The difference would be that an
  independent board would manage the National Recycle Refund Scheme, not the beverage
  industry, as is the case in SA and NT. The board would use the funds generated to
  develop enhancements to the scheme and recycling systems nationwide.</p>
